Hi there! I’m excited to share my 3D Calculator project, which I built to combine sleek design with practical functionality. This web-based application features a fully interactive calculator with a modern 3D aesthetic. It performs basic arithmetic operations, making it both a stylish and functional tool for everyday calculations.

The project utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:

HTML forms the structure, ensuring a clean and accessible layout.
CSS brings the 3D design to life with gradients, shadows, and smooth transitions.
JavaScript powers the calculator’s logic, enabling seamless interaction and instant results.
I added a responsive design, so the calculator looks great on any screen size, and included a footer to credit the work and share additional links. You’ll also find a hover and click feedback system that enhances the user experience with smooth animations.
